## Description

We have a even-numbered week, so at this time i don`t have a starter code, so i have to create my application from scratch. I created a portfolio page to showcase my progress through the course, with this portfolio i want to show my projects that i made so far(upload and update through the bootcamp), and test my skills with HTML and CSS, at the top i tried to use my GitHub Avatar to do a sub-header, and trying to show 4 projects for now, probably more with time. For acceptace Criteria, i need at list one of the works live and working, the navigation should lead the costumer to the corresponding section, one of the images should be larger in size than the other, and need to adapts to resize.

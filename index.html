        <div> 

            <p>
                As a student currently enrolled in a bootcamp, I'm eager to showcase my progress through four dynamic projects at the upcoming event. 
                Each project represents a milestone in my learning journey, demonstrating the skills I've acquired in HTML, CSS, and advanced CSS techniques. 
                The Horiseon Challenge exemplifies my ability to tackle real-world web development tasks head-on. With the Prework Website, 
                I aim to exhibit my talent for crafting visually appealing and functional web interfaces from scratch. Furthermore, 
                the CSS Snippet Cheatsheet highlights my proficiency in using CSS to optimize styling solutions. Finally, 
                the calculator project showcases my capacity to integrate complex functionality seamlessly into web applications. 
                These projects collectively reflect the dedication and hard work I've put into my studies, and I'm excited to share them as a testament to my growth as a front-end developer.
